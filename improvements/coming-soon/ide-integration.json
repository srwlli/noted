  "overview": {
    "description": "Integrate Noted with popular IDEs and code editors to allow developers to create, view, and manage notes directly from their development environment",
    "userNeed": [
      "Take notes without leaving IDE",
      "Link notes to specific code files or projects",
      "Quick capture of code snippets with context",
      "Sync notes between IDE and Noted app"
    ]

      "name": "VS Code Extension",
      "priority": "high",
      "features": [
        "Sidebar panel showing Noted notes",
        "Create/edit notes from command palette",
        "Sync with Noted app via Supabase",

    }
  },

  "technicalApproach": {
    "authentication": "OAuth or API key to connect IDE to user's Noted account",
    "dataSync": "Use existing Supabase API for CRUD operations",
    "storage": "Notes stored in Supabase (same as app)",
    "offline": "Local cache in IDE, sync when online"
  },

  "challenges": [
    "Maintaining separate codebases for each IDE",
    "Authentication flow in IDE context",
    "Keeping extensions updated with app changes",
    "Limited user base (developers only)"
  ],

  "estimatedDuration": "40-60 hours per IDE extension",

  "notes": [
    "VS Code extension would reach widest audience",
    "Consider API-first approach to support multiple IDEs",
    "May be better as separate open-source project"
  ]
