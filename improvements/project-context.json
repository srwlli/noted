  "session_summary": "Created comprehensive planning documentation for Note Actions bottom sheet features (Export, Upload, Publish, Embed). Export Action MVP plan finalized with 3 formats (HTML, Markdown, PDF) addressing 18 critical security and implementation issues including YAML injection prevention (js-yaml), Metro bundler platform-specific imports (.web.ts/.native.ts), popup blocker workarounds (iframe approach), and improved filename sanitization. Additional plans documented Upload (OAuth cloud integration), Publish (self-hosted public pages with SEO), and Embed (iframe/script widgets for external sites). All plans include technical implementations, database schemas, testing checklists, and realistic time estimates (15-17.5 hours for Export MVP).",
