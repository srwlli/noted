## üêõ Common Issues and Solutions

- **Problem**: Header content hidden behind iPhone notch
- **Solution**: Verify `env(safe-area-inset-top)` is applied with proper fallback

### Chrome Navigation Still Visible
- **Problem**: PWA doesn't hide browser UI
- **Solution**: Check `"display": "standalone"` in manifest and proper installation

### Status Bar Wrong Color
- **Problem**: Status bar doesn't match app theme
- **Solution**: Verify `apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style` meta tag

### Bottom Content Cut Off
- **Problem**: Navigation hidden behind home indicator
- **Solution**: Apply `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` to bottom elements

### PWA Won't Install
