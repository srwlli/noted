  "version": "2.0.0",

  "overview": {
    "goal": "Replace inline note form with modal popup for better UX",
    "motivation": "Create a more focused, mobile-friendly note creation experience",
    "current_behavior": "Form appears inline in notes list, pushing content down",
    "desired_behavior": "Form appears as overlay modal without affecting layout"
  },

  "user_experience_improvements": {
    "benefits": [
      "More focused user experience with modal overlay",
      "Notes list layout remains stable during note creation",
      "Mobile-app-like standard modal interaction pattern",
      "Less jarring transition with smooth overlay animation",
      "Action cards remain accessible at all times",
      "Better space utilization on smaller screens"
    ],
    "interaction_flow": [
      "User taps '+' button or 'Create new note' card",
      "Modal slides down from top with backdrop (using Animated API)",
      "User fills form in focused modal environment",
      "User can dismiss by tapping backdrop or cancel button",
      "On save success, modal animates back up and closes",
      "On cancel, modal animates back up and closes"
    ]
