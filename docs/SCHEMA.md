# Data Schema Reference (Consolidated)

As of September 20, 2025 the comprehensive architecture + schema guidance has been merged into `schema-app-report.md`. Refer to that document for:
- Configuration schemas (Expo, package.json, TypeScript, Tailwind)
- Theme and component definitions
- Navigation topology and component inventory
- Error/build schema structures and validation rules

> If you add or update schema details, edit `schema-app-report.md` and keep this file as a short pointer to avoid duplication.
